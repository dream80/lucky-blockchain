# How to use lucky

Lucky can be used as a blockchain gift coin
We hope that lucky will be used to like(点赞), reward（打赏）, donate（捐赠）, and pay for knowledge（知识付费）.  
If you like a person,  
like his creation,   
like his contribution,   
give him some LUCKY,   

hope he can have better luck and create better things  

Everyone is the node and center of this world, if they do great things, they deserve to be encouraged  

Price is not equal to value, but value needs to be reflected by price. If possible, we will also seek listing.

# Some common problems

##  Why there is no reward

Why the proof was found, but the coins were not obtained？

The most likely thing is that your wallet has not been synchronized yet, and the rewards won will only be displayed if the wallet is synchronized.  

In another case, the reward address of the farm is not your current wallet address. It often appears on people with two wallets(check your another wallet)  

## How to sync quickly?

The sync is too slow and the coins are token by others, what should I do? The quickest way is to directly use the synchronized DB file. The method of use is as follows:

1. Close the software after successful installation of Lucky

2. Download the DB folder

3. Replace the local DB folder

The local DB file path is generally: C:\Users\tony\\.lucky\mainnet\  **tony** is the user name of your computer

## How to get more coins?

In the case that the plots file remains unchanged, you can get a higher probability of block explosions by making yourself a shared node

There are several ways to share your own nodes:

1. Port mapping (port:16664)

2. DMZ

3. upnp
  
*If your Farmer PC have a public IP, you don’t need to do anything


## How to retrieve NFT pool rewards?

In lucky, the old plots are 100% reward, and the new plot has 2/3.   
If you want to retrieve the other 1/3, you can refer to it
